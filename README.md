# pydosbox
A frontend to the exellent DOSBox emulator.

This file profives information for the pyDosBox frontend.
It is still in alpha stage, although usable.

To use it you need python 2.3 and pygtk 2.0.

No installation is necessary. Just execute it and it will pop up!
I haven't test it under windows, so probably it won't run, although 
python and gtk are multi-platform.

If the DosBox application doesn't start, it's possible that the 
executable is not found. Then go to the ~/.pydosbox file and edit
the first option (self.dosboxpath) to reflect the position of the
dosbox executable.

For any comments you are welcomed to contact me.
